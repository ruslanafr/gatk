=============
High priority
=============

- [NOT GOOD] drop psi adjustment term in NB
    * the term is not necessary; will be captured by mean bias
    * on the other hand, it ruins the mean bias prior

- multi-threading for forward-backward

- write model params and sample posteriors to disk

- read model params from disk

- a case-sample denoising model

- a case-sample InferenceTask

- generate sample summary statistics output and plot
    - hmm data likelihood
      Q: how does this scale with read depth? we need to scale that out
    - bias factor likelihood
    - ?

- generate learning plots

- port notebook to pycharm
    * [DONE] model and inference
    * pre-processor

- generate simulated data
    * a fraction of low-coverage targets
    * a fraction of correlated dropouts (bad baits)
    * GC bias
    * a fraction of bi-allelic regions
    * a fraction of multi-allelic regions
    * smearing due to binning
    * throw in a fraction of samples with aneuploidy

- validate calls on simulated data
    * aneuploidy detection
    * low-coverage targets are not called as deletion
    * GC bias is modelled properly
    * bi- and multi-allelic regions are called properly

- prior optimization
    * think about the interaction between coherence length and prior

- wall-clock and copy number concordance for different learning rates (w/ the same convergence criterion)
    * on real data

- use diptest p-values to adjust initial copy number priors
    * idea: \pi = \alpha \pi_ref + (1 - \alpha) \pi_flat
            \alpha = (p_dip)^k for some k; run simulations to find optimum k?
    * implementation:
        1. the preprocessor compiles a list of "target summary statistics"
        2. a function takes the summary statistics and produces copy number priors (or class probabilities)
           as a first attempt, we can use a flat prior for all suspicious regions
        3. the first round of denoising ADVI with what we get from the diptest
        4. cycle forward-backward and Bayesian CN prior update rule
        5. we can increase a representative "inventory" of copy number priors if needed, e.g. by analyzing posteriors

- replace theano.function inputs w/ theano.function.In(..., borrow=True)

- replace tt.stack and python lists in calculating log_emission_stc with properly dimshuffled tensors

- compute on GPU

- accumulate log emission during ADVI iterations instead of posterior sampling
    * only useful when doing exact posterior expectation

- create a genome-wide blacklist for all CNV tools
    * non-diploid CN in reference (perhaps we can handle this properly instead of blacklisting?)
    * very low mappability
    * regions near centromeres

- [DONE] copy number prior inventory and Bayesian update

- [DONE] the HMM must directly write to the shared tensors

- [DONE] use random draws from q(c) instead of summing over all c states during learning
    * [SLOW] try choice and multinomial, check which is faster, or if either takes << 1s
    * ended up using argmax[q(c)] seems to work well

- [DONE] adaptive emission posterior sampling
    * sample in batches, calculate sd of posterior mean, stop when sd of mean is below a threshold

- [DONE] a convergence criterion useful for high learning rates:
    * [NOT GOOD] look at the sign changes of ELBO in the past N iterations; if converged, it must follow a
      binomial distribution. stop if the z-score is below a given threshold.
    * [NOT GOOD] compare sign changes w.r.t. mean
    * [WORKED] linear regression, calculate smoothed elbo drop, compared to variance

- [DONE] investigate the issue with ARD coefficients not diverging
    * the issue was with the optimizer: adam and adamax both give better results

- [DONE] play with PyMC3 minibatch
    * in practice, little is gained in memory footprint and a lot is lost in training time

- [DONE] single-sample sampling from emission posterior to reduce memory footprint
    * didn't work, too slow

- [NOT NECESSARY] initialization of W with random PCA
    * it may even bias the inference and pick the wrong solution

- [DIFFICULT] posterior sampling can still be optimized, perhaps by combining the adaptive sampler and the HMM
  into one theano function?

=============
Pre-processor
=============

- warn and/or remove samples with anomalously high over-dispersion

- warn and/or remove samples with aneuploidy

- [DONE] perform the dip/KS test after a naive GC correction to see if it helps
    * helped a bit but not much


================
Ideas to explore
================

- effective emission to take into account coverage smearing

- HMM prior optimization from data
    * given the log emission probability, assume priors over (1) the copy number prior
      and (2) coherence length of each copy number state. Perhaps we can optimize these?
    * I expect this to be very slow in practice, given the complexity of the c-marginalized model.
    * perhaps do this for a small region of the genome and use as "resource"?

- L_p norm with 0 < p < 2 instead of L_2 norm for the bias factor term
  the idea is that L_p norms with 0 < p < 2 tend to pick up bias factors that contribute
  to _all_ samples and will make it robust to outliers (i.e. high-variance samples)
